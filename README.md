# SOC Automation

## Objective

Design and implement an automated Security Operations Center (SOC) environment to detect, analyze, and respond to simulated security incidents. The project aimed to integrate multiple cybersecurity tools into a cohesive workflow, reducing manual investigation time and demonstrating the power of Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) in threat management.

### Skills Learned

- SOC workflows: alert triage, incident correlation, and response automation.
- Log ingestion, parsing, and security event correlation.
- Creating automated playbooks for incident investigation.
- Integrating SIEM, SOAR, and case management systems.
- Threat intelligence enrichment and API integration.
- Hands-on experience with alert lifecycle management.

### Tools Used

- **Wazuh:** SIEM platform for log management and threat detection, as demonstrated in the series.
- **TheHive:** Incident response platform for managing and tracking security incidents.
- **Shuffle:** Workflow automation tool for orchestrating and connecting various security tools.

## Steps
- **Project Planning:** Determine the scope of the home lab setup.
- **Tool Selection:** Select Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle as demonstrated in the series.
- **Environment Setup:** Follow the series to set up the home lab environment, including SIEM and incident response platforms.
- **Scripting:** Develop Python scripts to automate security tasks.
- **Playbook Development:** Create and test automated incident response playbooks based on scenarios from the series.
- **Integration:** Integrate Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle to create cohesive automation workflows.
- **Testing:** Conduct tests to ensure all automated processes work correctly and handle various incidents as expected.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the automated SOC system within the home lab, ensuring all components function as a unified system.
- **Monitoring and Maintenance:** Establish monitoring protocols for the automated system and perform regular updates and maintenance.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Iterate on the system by collecting feedback, analyzing performance, and making improvements as demonstrated in the series.
