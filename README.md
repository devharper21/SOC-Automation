# SOC Automation

## Objective

The objective of this SOC (Security Operations Center) automation project is to design and implement a system that automates repetitive and time-consuming security tasks, enhances threat detection and response, and improves the overall efficiency of SOC operations. This project aims to integrate various security tools and develop custom scripts or playbooks that streamline the incident management lifecycle, from detection to resolution. 

### Skills Learned

- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Practical experience with configuring and using Wazuh as a SIEM platform.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration:** Techniques for incorporating threat intelligence feeds into the SOC workflow.
- **API Integration:** Using REST APIs to connect and manage interactions between different security tools.
- **Incident Response Playbooks:** Developing and automating playbooks for handling various security incidents.
- **Continuous Monitoring and Alerting:** Setting up and fine-tuning monitoring and alerting mechanisms for real-time security event detection.
- **Cloud Security:** Applying cloud security practices within the context of a home lab setup.

### Tools Used

- **Wazuh:** SIEM platform for log management and threat detection, as demonstrated in the series.
- **TheHive:** Incident response platform for managing and tracking security incidents.
- **Shuffle:** Workflow automation tool for orchestrating and connecting various security tools.
- **Python:** The primary language used for scripting and automation.

## Steps
- **Project Planning:** Determine the scope of the home lab setup.
- **Tool Selection:** Select Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle as demonstrated in the series.
- **Environment Setup:** Follow the series to set up the home lab environment, including SIEM and incident response platforms.
- **Scripting:** Develop Python scripts to automate security tasks.
- **Playbook Development:** Create and test automated incident response playbooks based on scenarios from the series.
- **Integration:** Integrate Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle to create cohesive automation workflows.
- **Testing:** Conduct tests to ensure all automated processes work correctly and handle various incidents as expected.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the automated SOC system within the home lab, ensuring all components function as a unified system.
- **Monitoring and Maintenance:** Establish monitoring protocols for the automated system and perform regular updates and maintenance.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Iterate on the system by collecting feedback, analyzing performance, and making improvements as demonstrated in the series.
